Using Javascript I was able to do a clean up on the desktop without using my own CLI. 
I used  IntelliJ IDEA and downloaded the extension for python. 

Using Python langues i was able to install required libraries, desktop cleaner script,
Logging, automate execution. I was able to test and refine it.
